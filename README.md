# useful-files

These are my own useful alias files, scripts, etc.


Setup Instructions:

1) Clone this repo to ~/projects/rogiller/useful-files

2) Source `flex_aliases` in `~/.zshrc` 

`source ~/projects/rogiller/useful-files/flex_aliases`

*Note*: These are mostly not specific to Flex, but so far I've opted just to keep all my alias' in one file.

3) Soft Link `my.config` to get some SSH default settings

`ln -s /Users/roger/projects/rogiller/useful-files/my.config my.config`
